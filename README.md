# Room Sense Integration

This integration is in very early developpment, it is currently not usable nor installable.

## Integration Installation

TODO.

## ESP Setup

This integration is using ESP 32 with currently movement sensors to detect the direction of the individual. Unlike many integrations, this one is not using ESP Home to configure the ESP. It is rather based on a `std` Rust program.

As the integration is in early developpment, the sensor part is not yet ready.
